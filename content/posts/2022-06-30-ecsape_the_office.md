# I Resigned
Actually, i am satisfied with the company. I am  lucky to meet these friendly colleagues and it's my pleasure to work with them.

But after 5 years of working, i relaized that my body and thought can't sit at office for 8 hours any more.

You have to waste time in traffic.

You will be interperted by other's small talk so you need to fill your ears with music.

You have to sit at office and pretend to do your work even if your task is completed.

You meet your colleagues almost every day with rare communication because of our type of job doesn't need to face to face to collerabate with each other. This make me feel that we did'nt become more and more close during daily meeting.

I decided to try to become a freelancer or looking for a remtoe job. I am not sure what i relly want but my heart tell me to try a different lifestyle.


At last, thanks to my colleagues again
