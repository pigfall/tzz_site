  I am  glad to introduce the editor i most used to you. It's Neovim which you may be hear about.
  
  
  Why i choose the neovim instead of other more popular editor or idea as my editor for coding? 
  There has 3 progress which made me use neovim more and more often
  
  
  1. My computer perfomance is terrible. I need to choose a editor and just a editor. Though when i learn to program in Linux i choose the vim which is the embeded editor in linux system
  2. I got a job as a programer.  For the more effiency of develop i start to use IDEA to code in my daily work. Gradually i feel that coding in the IDEA makes me lose soul. I miss the feeling that using the vim in the termianl to code which make me look like a hacker in the film. And i start to look up some useful plugins to help my vim to more powerful.
  3. Thanks for the Neovim and LSP and the plugins provided by communtity. Finally i find my Jill.

  I have set up my neovim as a tiny IDEA. 
  
  I will introduce my better pratice in neovim to you.
